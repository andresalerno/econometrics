### Hello Finance Pythonistas! ðŸ‘‹

First of all, if you have not known me yet, please check it out my profile describe [here](https://github.com/andresalerno "My profile").

Seriously, I'm falling with love with this amazing place called [VERY ACADEMY](https://github.com/veryacademy).

If you're studying some basics, even some concepts deeper, I strongly recommend this guy, that I've bought some courses at UDEMY.

I hope you enjoy a lot!
