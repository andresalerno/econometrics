### Hello Finance R Programmers! ðŸ‘‹

First of all, if you have not known me yet, please check it out my profile describe [here](https://github.com/andresalerno "My profile").

Seriously, I'm falling with love with the comprehensive approach that has been teaching by [ANALISE MACRO](https://analisemacro.com.br/).

If you're studying some basics, even some concepts deeper, I strongly recommend these guys, that I've bought some courses in their website listed above.

I hope you enjoy a lot!
